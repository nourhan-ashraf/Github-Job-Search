### API
API Link: https://rapidapi.com/avaneesab5/api/jobsearch4

The provided API link is experiencing issues, which are affecting the pagination functionality and causing minor bugs. I have reached out to the developer to address these issues, and once they are resolved, I will update the project accordingly and fix any bugs that may occur.
